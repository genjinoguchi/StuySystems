Aim: Ceci n'est pas une pipe.

Pipe
	A conduit between 2 separate processes

	Pipes are unidirectional (a single pipe must be either read- or write-only in a process).
	The flow of information is always one-directional.

	You can transfer any data you like through a pipe using read/write


Two types of pipes: named and unnamed
Unnamed: 
	Unnamed pipes have no external identification (like a descriptor or name).

	pipe - <unistd.h>
		Create an unnamed pipe.

		Returns 0 if the pipe was created, 01 if not.

		Syntax:
		pipe(int descriptors[2]);

			Descriptors:	
			Array that will contain the descriptors for each end of the pipe.

Named:
