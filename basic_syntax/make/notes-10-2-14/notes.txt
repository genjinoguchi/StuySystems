GCC Tags
    gcc -c 
    	Separate Compilation
    gcc -o
    	Specify the name
	Ex: gcc -o awesome foo.c

Separate Compilation
	 You can combine multiple c files into a c program by including them all in one gcc command.
	 ex : gcc test.c string.c foo.c ...etc

	 You cannot have duplicate function or global variable names across these files.
	 Try to include the function headers everywhere.


	 If you don't have a main function in a file, you can run it like : 
	    gcc -c file.c
	 What happens? it gives you a file.o, which is a compiled file.

	 You can actually run the .o files with gcc file.o file2.o



	 That's because when you run gcc, it compiles, and then looks for other files as well as a main function in one of the linked file.
	 	If you don't have a main, it's gonna give you a linker error.


Make
	Create compiling instructions and setup dependencies.

	Standard name for make file : makefile

	Syntax:
		<TARGET>: <DEPENDENCIES>
		TAB<RULES>
