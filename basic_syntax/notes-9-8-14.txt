Aim: Time to C what we can do.

DO NOw: What command line commands would do the folowing

1) MOve foo.java from Desktop to Documents.
	-> mv Desktop/foo.java Documents/
2)Remove all .class files
	-> rm *.class
3)Figure out what gcc does
	-> C compiler
4) Connect to homer.stuy.edu from someplace else
	-> ssh genjinoguchi@homer.stuy.edu
5)COpy woohoo.c form your home directory on lisa.stuy.edu to a code/ driectory on home (Assume you are working on homer itself)
	->scp dw@lisa.stuy.edu:~/woohoo.c code/
	In fact, you don't actually need the ~/
