3Aim: How to write functioning code

Do Now: Write a c program that does the following.
   1) Creates adn initializes a string
   2) Calculates the length of the string and prints it out. (Do not write a function for this, just put all the code in main.


Methods of declaring strings
	char s[256];
		Manually.
	char s[256] = "Imagine";
	     Allocates 256 bytes, puts "Imagine" in the first 7 bytes and adds a null at the 8th byte.
	char s[] = "hello";
	     Allocates 8 bytes, adds a null at the front.



Functions
	C function headers
	  <return type> <function name>

	Functions pass variables by VALUE.
	You never have that nice java stuff where you pass an address, and change one thing and it changes something else for you.

	Parameters will allocate some more memory for itself, and then copy the value that is inputted into the function.

	Functions need to be defined before they can be used. (boooo)
