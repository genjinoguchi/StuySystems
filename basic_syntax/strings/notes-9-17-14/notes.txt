Aim: time to stop stringing you around.

Quick tips:
      Using the built-in manual from terminal (man)
      
      $ man ls ->>> It's gonna print LS(1) <- section of the manual that you are in.
      $ man malloc -->>>> It prints MALLOC(3) <- different section. It's actually going to tell you what the function does in C.

      $ man 3 printf -> Search the 3rd section.


STRINGS!
	C Strings are just char arrays. The null char at the end indicates the end of the string.
	Functions:
		char s[4];
		s[0] = 'h';
		s[1] = 'i';
		s[2] = 0;

		strlen(s)
			Returns the length of the string.
			Up to the null but not including.
