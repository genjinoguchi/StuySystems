Aim: Try nto to hurt yourself, the point is sharp.

DN: Write a C program that does the following
    1) Declare int, double and char poitners
    2) Print out the pointer's address for each (as an unsigned long);
    3) Add 1 to each poitner.
    4) Print out teh addresses again.

The int pointer, using its type, will change its address.
An int is of size 4; if you added 1 to the pointer, then it increases it by 4.
(Generally it increases it by the size * 4)

	   int *ip;
	   long *lp;
     
     Pointer arithmetic only works with + and -.



De-referencing:
	* is also used as the de-reference operator.
	It accesses the value at the memory locatino stored in a pointer.
	
	int i = 5;
	int *ip = &i;
	*ip++;	  This will set i to 6.

	Array variables are immutable pointers.

	int ray[5];
	int *rp = ray; //Ray is actually a pointer that points to the array.

	ray[3] is the equivalent of *(rp + 3).

3[ray]
