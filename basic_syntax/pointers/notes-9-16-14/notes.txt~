Aim: Try nto to hurt yourself, the point is sharp.

DN: Write a C program that does the following
    1) Declare int, double and char poitners
    2) Print out the pointer's address for each (as an unsigned long);
    3) Add 1 to each poitner.
    4) Print out teh addresses again.

The int pointer, using its type, will change its address.
An int is of size 4; if you added 1 to the pointer, then it increases it by 4.
(Generally it increases it by the size * 4)

int *ip;
long *lp;

Pointer arithmetic only works with + and -.
