Pointers - Now the fun really begins.

 Variables designed to store meory addresses (think references in java)
 * is used to declare a variable as a pointer type
   ex. int *p, double *q, char *r
 * is also used as the de-reference operator.
   It accesses the value at memory location stored in a pointer.
 & -  address of a variable
   ex. p = &x;

Every pointer is the same size-- it has to do with the amount of bits that you computer processor is.


In java, we had nullpointerexceptions: These indicated that there was a pointer that pointed to the 0 memory slot. (null)
