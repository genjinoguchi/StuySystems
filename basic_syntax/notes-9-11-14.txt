Aim: A vast array of possibiliites
===


Do now: What are properties of java arrays?

* Fixed size upon instantiation
* O(1) access
* Can only hold one type
* Size can be set at runtime
* Linear order is maintained.
* Can be multi-dimensional
* There is a default value for things.
* You can't go out of bounds.


Memory Management
* Memory allocation can either happen at compile time or at runtime (compile time vs dynamic)
* Compiler allocation
	Packaged with the binary of the program
	There is no standard default value.
	During runtime, it will give you a different value every time.
	There is no length function. HOWEVER, you can find the length of the array by dividing sizeof(ray) by sizeof(int).
	
	Musthave a fixed size
	There is no length function
	There is no boundary checking.

	Examples: float a
		int b[5] <- The number inside has to be a static value. CANNOT be a variable.
