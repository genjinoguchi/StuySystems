Where do priests live? The directory!


Directories
	A *nix directory is a file containing the names of the files within the directory along with basic information like file type.

Moving fiels into and out of a directory means changin the directory file, not actualy moving any other data.




getcwd - <unistd.h>
       Get the current working directory of the program.

       getcwd( <STRING BUFFER>, <SIZE> )
       getcwd( s, n );


chdir - <unistd.h>
      Change the working directory

      Returns 0 if successful, -1 (errno) if not.

      Keep track of file paths when using chdir!


opendir - <dirent.h>

	Open a directory file	
	It does not chdir.

	opendir( <PATH> )
	returns a pointer to a directory stream (DIR *), similar to a file descriptor.

	DIR *d
	d = opendir(".")

	Coupled with closedir( d );

readdir - <dirent.h>
	readdir( <DIRECTORY STREAM> )
	It returns the next entry, NULL if all entries ahve already been returned.

	struct dirent - <sys/types.h>
	       Some of the data members
	       	    d_name: File name.
		    d_type: File type as an int.

	Example:
		DIR *d;
		d = opendir("somedir");
		struct dirent *entry; //No need to allocate memory here.
		entry = readdir( d );

rewinddir - <dirent.h>
	  Resets the directory stream to the beginning

	 rewinddir( <DIRE CTORY STREAM> )
