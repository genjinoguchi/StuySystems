File IO


open - <fcntl.h>
     Add a file to the file table and returns its file descriptor.

     If open fails, -1 si returned, extra error information can be found in errno
     	errno is an int variable that can be found in <errno.h>, using strerror (in string.h) on errno will return a string description of the error.
