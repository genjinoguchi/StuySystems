Aim: I need information!

DN: Make a folder, and put some things in the folder.



stat - <sys/stat.h>

     Get information about a file.

     stat( <PATH>, <STAT BUFFER> )

     	   struct stat sb; //Not a typedef'ed struct
	   stat("foo", &sb);

     You use stat to configure the metadata.


     PATH - it's just the path, not a file in the file table.

     STAT BUFFER - Must be a pointer to a struct stat.
     	  All of the file information gets put into the stat struct.
	  
	  Some of the fields in struct stat : 
	       st_size
	          file size in bytes

	       st_uid, st_gid
	       	  group and user id's.

	       st_mode
		  file permissions as an octal number.
		  note : print octal numbers as %o.

 	       st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime
	          last access, last modification

		  The time comes out as some wack number.
		  
		  #include <time.h>
		  ctime(<POINTER>)


     struct time_t t;
     printf("The time is now : %s\n", time(&t))
