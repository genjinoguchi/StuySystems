Aim: Don't fget this lesson

Create the string: "the point (x,y) is: (5, -1)"
using the variables x and y.

Function: sprintf( <DESTINATION>, <FORMAT STRING>, <VARIABLES>)
	  Copy a format string into another string.
	  

fgets - <stdio.h>
      Read in from a file stream and store it in a string.

      fgets( <DESTINATION>, <BYTES>, <FILE POINTER>)

      fgets( s, n, f)
      	     Reads at most n characters from file stream f and stores it in s.

	     File pointers are different from FILE DESCRIPTOR-- it's not just an integer.
	     FILE * type, more complex than a file descriptor.
	     stdin is a FILE * descriptor.

	     It will stop at a newline, end of file, or the byte limit.
	     It keeps the newline character as part of the string, appends the NULL after.


	     Read from standard in : fgets(s, 256, stdin)


      strsep - <string.h>
      	     Used for parsing a string with a common delimeter.

	     strsep( <STRING>, <DELIMETER>)
	     Locates the first occurrence of the delimeter in a string and replaces that character with NULL.

	     Returns the beginning of the original string
	     Sets a parameter to teh string starting at 1 index past the location of the new 0.
