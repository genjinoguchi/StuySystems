Aim: Don't fget this lesson

Create the string: "the point (x,y) is: (5, -1)"
using the variables x and y.

Function: sprintf( <DESTINATION>, <FORMAT STRING>, <VARIABLES>)
	  Copy a format string into another string.
	  

fgets - <stdio.h>
      Read in from a file stream and store it in a string.

      fgets( <DESTINATION>, <BYTES>, <FILE POINTER>)

      fgets( s, n, f)
      	     Reads at most n characters from file stream f and stores it in s.

	     File pointers are different from FILE DESCRIPTOR-- it's not just an integer.
	     FILE * type, more complex than a file descriptor.
	     stdin is a FILE * descriptor.
