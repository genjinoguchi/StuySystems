     Changing the usual input/output behavior of a program.

     Command line redirection

		Example:
		ls > file_list

	     >>

	     	Example: cat boo 2> errorfile

	     &> redirects errythang to a file.

	     | (pipe)
	       Redirect stdout from one ciommand to stdin of the next.

      Redirection in C programs

          dup2 - <unistd.h>
	       Redirect one file descriptor to another.

	       dup2 (fd1, fd2)
	       	    fd = open("foo", O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC);
	       	    dup2( fd, STDOUT_FILENO);
		    This makes all of the outputs go to the file "foo"
