Aim: c what I did there

DN: 
	List the java primitive variable types.
	- Int, short, long
	- float, long
	- char
	- boolean
	- array
	- byte - 8 bit integer. -128 <--> 127
	-

Differences for C:
	All C primitives are numeric.
	The only difference is floating point vs integer and size of variable.
	Size can be platform dependant (Depending on your operating system and your hardware)
		sizeof(<TYPE>) -> Tells you the number of bytes it takes up.
		sizeof(int)

Type		Standard Size

int		4
short		2
long		8
float		4
double		8
char		1

All boolean values are numbers.
0 is false.
All other numbers are true.

Awesome line: while(x)
Not awesome line: if(x=1){
